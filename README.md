# Tectonic — Agentic AI Platform

A cloud-agnostic platform for building, running and governing agentic AI
applications: 34 modules spanning orchestration/runtime, intelligence,
data, memory, governance/safety, quality/trust and interoperability. Full
module catalogue: [`docs/agentic-platform-final-module-table.md`](docs/agentic-platform-final-module-table.md).

## Status

| Module | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — Workflow Engine | Built — [`modules/workflow-engine`](modules/workflow-engine) |
| 2 — Conversational Engine | Built — [`modules/conversational-engine`](modules/conversational-engine) |
| 3 — LLM Gateway | Built — [`modules/llm-gateway`](modules/llm-gateway) |
| 4 — Tool Orchestration | Built — [`modules/tool-orchestration`](modules/tool-orchestration) |
| 5–34 | Not yet started |

Each module is designed, built and tested independently (its own repo-style
subtree under `modules/`, own README, own CI-shaped test tiers), then
integrated. See a module's low-level design doc under `docs/` before
building against it.

## Cross-module integration, once deployed together

Modules 2 and 4 both call out to Module 3 (LLM Gateway) and, for Module 2,
Guardrails/Long-Term Memory/Human Oversight; Module 4 additionally calls
Guardrails and Sentinel Agents for tool synthesis. Each module talks to
those dependencies through its own `dependency_stub_base_url` config knob
today (pointed at a lightweight stub service that ships with each module —
see each module's `stubs/dependency-stub/`), so every module builds, runs
and is fully unit-tested standalone. Deploying more than one module
together means pointing each one's client config at the real peer module's
base URL instead of its stub — no code changes required, since every
external dependency sits behind a Protocol port with an HTTP adapter
already implemented.

## Modules

### Module 1: Workflow Engine

Executes agent workflows as DAGs/graphs with neurosymbolic step routing,
confidence-gated autonomy, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints — the
orchestration core the rest of the platform's modules plug into. Design doc:
[`docs/module-01-workflow-engine-lld.md`](docs/module-01-workflow-engine-lld.md).
Build: [`modules/workflow-engine`](modules/workflow-engine).

### Module 2: Conversational Engine

Multi-turn dialogue management: persona control, channel adaptation
(web/WhatsApp/voice), streaming responses, and emotional/urgency-aware
handoff to a human. Design doc:
[`docs/module-02-conversational-engine.md`](docs/module-02-conversational-engine.md).
Build: [`modules/conversational-engine`](modules/conversational-engine).

### Module 3: LLM Gateway

The only module permitted to call model providers directly — quality-aware
routing, semantic caching, cost governance and failover across 20+
providers, behind an OpenAI-compatible API. Design doc:
[`docs/module-03-llm-gateway.md`](docs/module-03-llm-gateway.md).
Build: [`modules/llm-gateway`](modules/llm-gateway).

### Module 4: Tool Orchestration

The single point through which every agent action against an external tool
passes: MCP-based discovery and invocation, retries, circuit-breaking,
reliability-scored routing, and guarded just-in-time tool synthesis. Design
doc: [`docs/module-04-tool-orchestration.md`](docs/module-04-tool-orchestration.md).
Build: [`modules/tool-orchestration`](modules/tool-orchestration).

## Running any module locally

```bash
cd modules/<module-name>
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                                                    # unit tests, no external services needed
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build    # full stack (Postgres/Redis + dependency-stub)
```
