# Tectonic — Agentic AI Platform

A cloud-agnostic platform for building, running and governing agentic AI
applications: 34 modules spanning orchestration/runtime, intelligence,
data, memory, governance/safety, quality/trust and interoperability. Full
module catalogue: [`docs/agentic-platform-final-module-table.md`](docs/agentic-platform-final-module-table.md).

## Status

| Module | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — Workflow Engine | Built — [`modules/workflow-engine`](modules/workflow-engine) |
| 2–34 | Not yet started |

Each module is designed, built and tested independently (its own repo-style
subtree under `modules/`, own README, own CI-shaped test tiers), then
integrated. See a module's low-level design doc under `docs/` before
building against it.

## Module 1: Workflow Engine

Executes agent workflows as DAGs/graphs with neurosymbolic step routing,
confidence-gated autonomy, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints — the
orchestration core the rest of the platform's modules plug into. Design doc:
[`docs/module-01-workflow-engine-lld.md`](docs/module-01-workflow-engine-lld.md).
Build: [`modules/workflow-engine`](modules/workflow-engine).

```bash
cd modules/workflow-engine
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                                                    # 23 unit tests, no external services
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build    # full stack
```
